Note to BharatFD Team
I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to BharatFD's mission of making financial services accessible to all Indians. While I haven't deployed this project due to ongoing academic commitments and examinations, I have developed a robust backend system that demonstrates my technical capabilities and understanding of scalable applications.
This project showcases my ability to:

Build scalable Node.js applications
Work with MongoDB and RESTful APIs
Handle multi-language support crucial for Indian markets
Write clean, maintainable code
Think about user needs and system scalability

I am confident that, if given the opportunity, I can contribute significantly to BharatFD's technical initiatives and help build systems that serve India's diverse user base. I look forward to discussing how my skills and enthusiasm align with BharatFD's goals.
